# ![app icon](./.github/readme-images/app-icon.png)Tachiyomi Extensions

This repository contains the available extension catalogues for the [Tachiyomi](https://github.com/tachiyomiorg/tachiyomi) app.

# Usage

Extension sources can be downloaded, installed, and uninstalled via the main Tachiyomi app. They are installed and uninstalled like regular apps, in `.apk` format.

## Downloads

If you prefer to directly download the APK files, they are available  at https://github.com/keiyoushi/tachiyomi-extensions/tree/main/apk.

# Requests

Source requests here are meant as up-for-grabs for any developer, thus it's impossible to provide a time estimation for any of them. Furthermore, some sites are impossible to do, usually because of various technical reasons.
